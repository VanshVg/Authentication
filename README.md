# Authentication Module

In this project when user signsup user's data is added to database then during login user is asked to enter their correct email and password to be able to login, if the login is successful one token is generated using JsonWebToken (JWT) and if user wants to edit or delete the data he/she must have this token for that.



- The project uses:
    * Node.Js
    * Express.Js
    * Mongoose.Js
    * jsonwebtoken
    * Bcrypt
    
- Project's goal is to learn concepts of jsonwebtoken.
